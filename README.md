# 📊 Sales Analytics Dashboard & Insights

This repository contains a **Tableau dashboard** and an accompanying **analysis document** built using a retail **Sales dataset**. The project showcases key business metrics, visual exploration of trends, and answers to specific analytical questions.

## 📌 About the Dashboard

The dashboard was created using **Tableau** and highlights the following:

### 💡 KPIs Tracked:
- 💰 Total Sales
- 📈 Total Profit
- 🧾 Number of Orders
- 👥 Number of Customers
- 🧮 Average Order Value

### 📊 Visualizations Included:
- **Sales by Category & Sub-Category**
- **Profit-to-Sales Ratio by Sub-Category**
- **Sales Trend Over Time**
- **Sales vs Profit by State & City**
- **Interactive Filters** (Category, State, Year, Payment Mode, etc.)

All charts are **interactive**, allowing users to drill down, filter, and dynamically explore the data.

## 📄 Analysis Document

The `Analysis.docx` includes detailed answers to several data-driven business questions, such as:

- Which customers made the most purchases or profit?
- Which states are underperforming (high sales, low profit)?
- Which sub-category is growing fastest over time?
- Are some payment modes more profitable?
- How does seasonality affect sales?

Each answer includes supporting charts or metrics derived from the Tableau dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau** for data visualization and dashboard design
- **Excel** for dataset cleaning and preprocessing
- **Word** for presenting insights and answering questions

## 📈 Key Learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in the end-to-end process of data analysis and dashboard creation using Tableau. 
Key takeaways include:

### 🔹 Dashboard Design & Layout
- Learned to structure dashboards for maximum clarity and usability
- Applied layout containers (horizontal/vertical) to align and group visual components effectively
- Incorporated KPI cards and filter sidebars to enhance interactivity and provide at-a-glance metrics

### 🔹 Data Analysis & Insight Generation
- Explored trends in sales and profitability across different dimensions like Category, State, City, and Payment Mode
- Identified underperforming regions and high-performing customer segments through comparative analysis
- Evaluated the impact of seasonality and customer behavior patterns using time series charts

### 🔹 Tableau Techniques
- Created calculated fields for metrics like:
  - **Profit-to-Sales Ratio**
  - **Average Order Value**
- Implemented filters and actions to allow multi-level interactivity across all charts
- Utilized scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs effectively

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Pre-Tableau)
- Cleaned raw dataset using Excel by:
  - Removing inconsistencies
  - Ensuring correct data types
  - Creating derived columns where necessary

This project helped bridge the gap between raw data and decision-making, while reinforcing strong analytical thinking, visualization best practices, and storytelling with data.
